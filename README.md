# EchoBot-Discord-Bot
A simple Discord bot (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Hey, this is my first github thing, so forgive me if i do some stuff wrong

pretty much just some python code, this uses the PyCharacterAI library by [Xtr4F](https://github.com/Xtr4F/PyCharacterAI/tree/main)

make sure to have discord.py installed too. i did this on my raspberry pi 4b, so things might be a bit different

this isnt really meant for multiple server use, but if its for small servers (like ones with your friends), then it should be fine. project is open source, **feel free to use/modify the code however you want (with credit given ofc)**

most of the code is generated by chatgpt (im not the best at coding, sorry)
