# EchoBot-Discord-Bot
A simple Discord bot (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Hey, this is my first github thing, so forgive me if i do some stuff wrong

small disclaimer, idk what pull requests and stuff are, so please forgive me if i dont do them/do them wrong. im still learning github!

pretty much just some python code, this uses the PyCharacterAI library by [Xtr4F](https://github.com/Xtr4F/PyCharacterAI/tree/main)

make sure to have discord.py installed too. i did this on my raspberry pi 4b, so things might be a bit different

just a heads up if you're also wanting to do it on a raspberry pi, i had to make a python virtual environment to install the libraries. i also created a custom service so it auto-boots the python program on startup

this isnt really meant for multiple server use, but if its for small servers (like ones with your friends), then it should be fine. project is open source, **feel free to use/modify the code however you want (with credit given ofc)**

most of the code is generated by chatgpt (im not the best at coding, sorry)

my official site is linked [here](https://sites.google.com/view/tiptopsbots/home), where you can find more about my bots, me, etc
